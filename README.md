# LaneSensingOperator

The increasing number of pedestrians immersed in their smartphone screens, so-called
“smombies,” has caused them to lose spatial awareness, especially when entering the road, failing to
perceive that they may be exposed to potential dangers. Hence, the smombies are becoming more
vulnerable to unexpected, sometimes even fatal, accidents on road today. 

The source code introduces smartphone-based Lane-Sensing Operator, which enables real-time lane detection to smartphone-occupied
users on the road. This algorithm has shown a 91.9% accuracy in detecting road lanes, exhibiting its
ability to contribute to enhancing pedestrian safety.
